We need to understand where the bottleneck is. \u00a0I looked in logs and we don't currently have enough logging to know where in the flow the delay is. \u00a0In general there are 3 potential places:\n\n* Get user record from memory cache/Mongo. I'd think for a service account that this would be cached, but would be good to know how long this takes.\n* Call Okta to get the token\n* Persist a hash of the token to Cosmos\n\nThe work in this bug will add logging to those 3 places that will log if any of them take > 1 second",
